## BRIEF INTRO:
**Athlentiq** is an android application developed with Kotlin that leverages the capabilities of MediaPipe Pose Landmark Detection. It accurately counts repetitions, enhancing your workout experience and also its an all-in-one AI fitness companion that turns your cam into a personal trainer: it watches you work out, counts your reps in real time using pose estimation, and tracks your progress over time — no wearables, no manual logging, just you and your browser.
